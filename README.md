# NodeJS Challenge

This practical part of the interview is designed to assess your technical skills. There is no single correct answer to this test, but we highly value good performance, well-tested applications, strong logic for aggregations, and excellent clean code and creativity.

## Problem Statement

The problem involves creating an API using Express for a sneakers store. You are required to implement two public routes:

- **/products**: This route should return an array containing only the products that are currently in stock.
- **/price/{user_id}/{nombre_producto}**: Some clients in this business have special pricing for certain brands. This route should return the special price for the given client and brand, if available. If the client doesn't have a special price for the brand, the route should return the base price.

If you encounter any difficulties or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at cleonve@drenvio.com. We wish you the best of luck!
